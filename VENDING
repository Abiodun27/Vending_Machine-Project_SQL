/* Data Analysis Plan Steps */
--1. Definition of Objectives
--2. Data extraction and collection
--3. Choice of tools
--4. Application of Analysis techniques
--5. Delivery of Result


-- Lets see distinct values from the columns
SELECT DISTINCT status FROM  vending_machine_sales;
SELECT DISTINCT location FROM  vending_machine_sales;
SELECT DISTINCT machine FROM  vending_machine_sales;
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM  vending_machine_sales;
SELECT DISTINCT status FROM  vending_machine_sales;
SELECT DISTINCT type FROM  vending_machine_sales;
SELECT DISTINCT status FROM  vending_machine_sales;

SELECT * FROM vending_machine_sales
WHERE category IS NOT NULL;





--1. Which machine counted the highest number of sales?
SELECT x.*
FROM (
		SELECT machine, COUNT(product) AS Number_of_sales
		FROM vending_machine_sales
		GROUP BY machine
		ORDER BY Number_of_sales DESC
	  ) AS x
WHERE Number_of_sales = 2567;

--2. What was the most used payment method?
SELECT x.*
FROM (
		SELECT type AS payment_type, COUNT(type) AS Number_of_payment_type
		FROM  vending_machine_sales
		GROUP BY type
		ORDER BY Number_of_payment_type DESC
	 ) AS x
WHERE Number_of_payment_type = 4297;

--3. Which categories of products counted the highest number of sales
SELECT 
CASE
   WHEN  category IS NULL THEN 'others'
   ELSE category
   END category,
COUNT(product) AS Number_of_sales
FROM vending_machine_sales
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY Number_of_sales DESC;

--4. What are the most popular products?
SELECT product, COUNT(product) AS most_popular_products
FROM vending_machine_sales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY most_popular_products DESC;

--5. How were sales over the months for each machine?
SELECT DISTINCT machine, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM transdate) AS month, COUNT(*) AS count_of_machine
FROM vending_machine_sales
GROUP BY machine, month
ORDER BY machine, month ;

SELECT machine,  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM transdate) AS month,
SUM(COUNT(product)) OVER(PARTITION BY machine ORDER BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM transdate)) AS cnt
FROM vending_machine_sales
GROUP BY machine, month
ORDER BY machine, month 

SELECT DISTINCT machine, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM transdate) AS month, COUNT(*) AS count_of_machine,
DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY machine ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC ) AS drk
FROM vending_machine_sales
GROUP BY machine, month
ORDER BY machine, month,  COUNT(*) DESC


-- 6. In which month is most sales made by each machine?
SELECT * FROM    (
